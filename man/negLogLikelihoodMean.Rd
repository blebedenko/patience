\title{(negative) mean log-likelihood for the sinusoidal arrivals model
The mean is returned instead of the sum - should help gradient based optimizers}

negLogLikelihoodMean(params, dati)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A vector with values (gamma,lambda_0, theta).}

\item{dati}{compact simulation results for memory economy (A,W,X).}

\item{RES}{simulation results(should be NULL if dati supplied)}
}
\value{
The negative log-likelihood at the point provided.
