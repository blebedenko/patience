\title{(negative) mean log-likelihood for known sinusoidal arrivals
The mean is returned instead of the sum - should help gradient based optimizers}
\usage{
negLogLikelihoodMean.KnownArrival(theta.vec, params, AWX)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A vector with values (gamma,lambda_0)}

\item{AWX}{compact simulation results for memory economy (A,W,X).}

\item{theta}{a vector of theta values}
}
\value{
The negative log-likelihood at the point provided.
